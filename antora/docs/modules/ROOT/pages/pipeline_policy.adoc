These rules are applied to Tekton pipeline definitions.

[#task_bundle_package]
== link:#task_bundle_package[Pipeline definition Task bundle policies]

To be able to reproduce and audit builds accurately it's important to know exactly what happens during the build. To do this Enterprise Contract requires that all tasks are defined in a set of known and trusted task bundles. This package includes rules to confirm that the tasks in a Pipeline definition are defined in task bundles, and that the task bundles are from the list of known and trusted bundles.

* Package name: `task_bundle`

[#task_bundle__missing_required_data]
=== link:#task_bundle__missing_required_data[Missing required data]

Confirm the `trusted_tasks` rule data was provided, since it's required by the policy rules in this package.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Missing required trusted_tasks data`
* Code: `task_bundle.missing_required_data`
* https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/pipeline/task_bundle/task_bundle.rego#L94[Source, window="_blank"]

[#task_bundle__untrusted_task_bundle]
=== link:#task_bundle__untrusted_task_bundle[Task bundle is not trusted]

For each Task in the Pipeline definition, check if the Tekton Bundle used is a trusted task.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Pipeline task '%s' uses an untrusted task bundle '%s'`
* Code: `task_bundle.untrusted_task_bundle`
* https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/pipeline/task_bundle/task_bundle.rego#L79[Source, window="_blank"]

[#task_bundle__out_of_date_task_bundle]
=== link:#task_bundle__out_of_date_task_bundle[Task bundle is out of date]

For each Task in the Pipeline definition, check if the Tekton Bundle used is the most recent.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator warning]#WARNING#
* WARNING message: `Pipeline task '%s' uses an out of date task bundle '%s', new version of the Task must be used before %s`
* Code: `task_bundle.out_of_date_task_bundle`

[#task_bundle__empty_task_bundle_reference]
=== link:#task_bundle__empty_task_bundle_reference[Task bundle reference is empty]

Check that a valid task bundle reference is being used.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Pipeline task '%s' uses an empty bundle image reference`
* Code: `task_bundle.empty_task_bundle_reference`
* https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/pipeline/task_bundle/task_bundle.rego#L66[Source, window="_blank"]

[#task_bundle__disallowed_task_reference]
=== link:#task_bundle__disallowed_task_reference[Task bundle was not used or is not defined]

Check for the existence of a task bundle. This rule will fail if the task is not called from a bundle.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator failure]#FAILURE#
* FAILURE message: `Pipeline task '%s' does not contain a bundle reference`
* Code: `task_bundle.disallowed_task_reference`
* https://github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies/blob/{page-origin-refhash}/policy/pipeline/task_bundle/task_bundle.rego#L52[Source, window="_blank"]

[#task_bundle__unpinned_task_bundle]
=== link:#task_bundle__unpinned_task_bundle[Unpinned task bundle reference]

Check if the Tekton Bundle used for the Tasks in the Pipeline definition is pinned to a digest.

* Rule type: [rule-type-indicator warning]#WARNING#
* WARNING message: `Pipeline task '%s' uses an unpinned task bundle reference '%s'`
* Code: `task_bundle.unpinned_task_bundle`

[#basic_package]
== link:#basic_package[Pipeline definition sanity checks]

Policies to confirm the Tekton Pipeline definition has the expected kind.

* Package name: `basic`

[#basic__expected_kind]

[#required_tasks_package]
== link:#required_tasks_package[Required tasks]

Konflux expects that certain Tekton tasks are executed during image builds. This package includes policy rules to confirm that the pipeline definition includes those required tasks.

* Package name: `required_tasks`

[#required_tasks__missing_future_required_task]
=== link:#required_tasks__missing_future_required_task[Missing future required task]

Produce a warning when a task that will be required in the future is not currently included in the Pipeline definition.

* Code: `required_tasks.missing_future_required_task`
