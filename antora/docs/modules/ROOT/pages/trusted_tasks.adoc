== Task Provenance using trusted Task list

The Enterprise Contract requires that all Konflux pipelines
use only tasks with the recorded provenance in the trusted Task list. See also
the "Trusted Task" xref:release_policy#trusted_task_package[release] and
xref:pipeline_policy#untrusted_task_bundle[policy] rules where this list is
used.

The list of trusted Tasks is time based. A Task that is trusted today is not
necessarily trusted tomorrow. The trusted Task list may contain bundles that are
"too old" and no longer trusted. The reason for this behavior is to allow
users a certain period of time to upgrade to a newer version of the Task.

Any record in the trusted Task List with an effective date in the future, and
the record with the most recent effective date *not* in the future are
trusted. For example, consider a list that includes the following trusted
tasks:

* a, effective on 2022-10-23
* b, effective on 2022-10-22
* c, effective on 2022-10-20
* d, effective on 2022-10-19

If today is 2022-10-21, then the Tasks a, b, and c are trusted, while d is not.

Even when using a Task recorded in the trusted Task list, some policy rules may
emit a warning if the reference used is not the latest one on the list. This is
an attempt to notify users that although there are no violations today, an
update is required for continued compliance. In the example above, using b or c
would result in such a warning.

The process of adding Tasks to the list of trusted Tasks is described
xref:trusting_tasks.adoc[here].

== Trusted Task list

The structure of the trusted Task list is best illustrated by an example:

[source,yaml]
----
task-bundles: <1>
  registry.io/org/task-bundle:
    - digest: sha256:...
      effective_on: "2023-05-14T00:00:00Z"
      tag: latest
trusted_tasks: <2>
  git+https://gitforge.io/org/tasks.git//tasks/my-task/0.1/my-task.yaml: <3>
    - effective_on: "2023-05-14T00:00:00Z" <4>
      expires_on: "2024-05-14T00:00:00Z" <5>
      ref: 3672a... <6>
  oci://registry.io/org/task-bundle:latest: <3>
    - effective_on: "2023-05-14T00:00:00Z" <4>
      expires_on: "2024-05-14T00:00:00Z" <5>
      ref: sha256:... <6>

----
<1> Legacy format for tracking acceptable bundles, here only for backward
compatibility. Will be removed entirely in future.
<2> Trusted Tasks list in the new format, containing:
<3> Provenance URI, i.e. where the Task can be retrieved from
<4> The _effective on_ time
<5> The _expires on_ time
<6> Unique reference of the Task within the provenance URI (git commit id or
image digest)
