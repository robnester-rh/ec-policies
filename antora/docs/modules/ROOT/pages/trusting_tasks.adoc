This document details the process of trusting a Task originating in a
link:{tekton-bundles}[Tekton Bundle] or git repository. The term
xref:{trusted-tasks}[trusted Task] refers to a Task that has its unique
reference, a image digest or a git commit id listed in the Trusted Task list.

[NOTE]
.Former naming: Acceptable bundles
====
This functionality was previously named Acceptable bundles. Trusted task is the
new name for a very similar approach of creating an allow list of Tasks by
tracking their origin. To maintain backward compatibility the data formats for
acceptable bundles (under the `task-bundles` key) and the new data formats for
trusted tasks (under the `trusted-tasks` key) are generated. Here we focus
solely on the new format.
====

When evaluating a certain input, certain policy rules enforce that only trusted
tasks were used. The xref:{attestation-task-bundle}[Attestation Task Bundle]
package and the xref:{:image-built-by-trusted-task:}[Image built by trusted
Task], for example, performs this check on SLSA Provenance attestations.

To reduce errors, use the link:{ec-track-bundle}[ec track bundle] command to
manage entries in the list of trusted tasks. The command adds a list of Tekton
Bundles and git repository information to an existing list of trusted tasks. It
can also generate a new list of trusted tasks.

For example, consider the two hypothetical Tekton Bundles,
`example.com/org/bacon:v1.0` and  `example.com/org/spam:v2.0`. These Tekton
Bundles each include one or more Tekton Tasks. Also let's consider a git
repository hosted at `gitforge.io/org/tasks.git` with the Task definition in the
`tasks/my-task/0.3/my-task.yaml` path within it. The snippet below illustrates
how to generate a new list of trusted tasks containing these Tasks.

NOTE: The `ec track tekton-task` command marks new entries as required in 30 days. This gives users a
reasonable time-window to update.

Now, imagine a new Tekton Bundle is available at `example.com/org/bacon:v1.1`. Add this new Tekton
Bundle to the existing list of trusted Tasks like this:

[,bash]
----
$ ec track tekton-task \
    --bundle example.com/org/bacon:v1.1 \
    --input trusted-tasks.yaml \
    --replace

$ cat trusted-tasks.yaml

Be sure to include the `trusted-tasks.yaml` file in a data source in your policy configuration.

== An Example

Automation using the process described above manages the trusted Tasks used in
Konflux. This section describes how.

The repository link:{build-definitions}[konflux-ci/build-definitions]
contains all the Tekton definitions used by Konflux. The CI/CD process on that
repository performs the following actions:

1. Determine which Tekton definitions have modifications.
2. Build a new Tekton Bundle for each modified Tekton definition.
3. Use the `ec track trusted-tesk` command to update the list of trusted Tasks
   held in `quay.io/konflux-ci/tekton-catalog/data-acceptable-bundles` image.

The new Tasks defined in that repository become trusted Tasks as soon as the
pull request merges.

== Adding a new trusted Task to Konflux

The process to add a new task defintion to the existing Red Hat trusted task
list is relatively uncomplicated and is detailed below.

Before adding a new task, however, there are a few things to consider:

* The added task should have a wide audience for usage. Tasks added to the build
  definitions repository should not be specific to a single product or team.
* Submitting a task to the build-definitions repository has the practical effect
  of marking a task as "trusted" by Red Hat.
* To discuss your idea for a new task, visit the #forum-konflux-build channel on
  the Red Hat Developer Slack.

In order to add a new task to the existing set of Red Hat trusted Tasks, the
process is as follows:

* https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo[Fork]
  the https://github.com/konflux-ci/build-definitions[build defintions] repository.
* Create and submit a https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request[pull request]
  with your new task.
* Once the pull request is submitted and approvevd, the CI process will
  automatically build the new task and add it to the list of trusted Tasks.

== Adding a custom task to the trusted task list

Some users may want to add a custom build task to the default trusted Task
list without pushing that task to the upstream trusted Task list. Below is a
possible approach to make that happen.

EC requires a customized policy in order to accept a custom task. Such a policy
must include an additional data source with task provenance information and
digests relevant to the new custom task.

For example, starting with
https://github.com/enterprise-contract/config/blob/main/redhat-no-hermetic/policy.yaml[Red Hat's non-hermetic build policy],
a new data source can be added under the `sources.data` key. See
https://github.com/simonbaird/securesign-ec-config/blob/main/policy.yaml#L24[this policy] for a complete example.

[,bash]
----
name: Secure Sign Custom Enterprise Contract Policy

description: >-
  Based on the standard Red Hat (non hermetic) policy
  (see https://github.com/enterprise-contract/config/blob/main/redhat-no-hermetic/policy.yaml)
  but with one additional data source.

publicKey: "k8s://openshift-pipelines/public-key"

sources:
  - name: Default with extra source
    policy:
      - github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies//policy/lib
      - github.com/enterprise-contract/ec-policies//policy/release

    data:
      - oci::quay.io/konflux-ci/tekton-catalog/data-acceptable-bundles:latest
      - github.com/release-engineering/rhtap-ec-policy//data

      # This is the one additional data source
      # See https://github.com/simonbaird/securesign-ec-config/tree/main/policy-data
      - github.com/simonbaird/securesign-ec-config//policy-data?ref=main

    config:
      include:
        - '@redhat'
      exclude:
        - hermetic_build_task
        - tasks.required_tasks_found:prefetch-dependencies
----

That custom data source should be kept updated as new Tekton task bundles are
pushed, perhaps via some automation or using
https://enterprisecontract.dev/docs/ec-cli/main/ec_track_bundle.html[`ec track tekton-task`].

The customized policy can be provided to EC with the `--policy` parameter, and
should allow custom tasks to validate using the new data source.

To confirm it works as expected, you can run EC locally, for example:

[,bash]
----
$ export IMAGE=quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/rhtas-tenant/rhtas-stack-1-0-beta/rekor-server@sha256:7fb224c62e5ea5b43ad123529487f07553626e9cd1f908d515114ee414679d6b

$ export POLICY=github.com/simonbaird/securesign-ec-config

$ ec validate image --image $IMAGE --policy $POLICY --public-key <(cat key.pub) --ignore-rekor --output data=data.yaml --output policy-input=policy-input.json --output yaml | yq .components[].violations
----

Note that the `--output data` and `--output policy-input` flags are not strictly
necessary, but may be helpful for troubleshooting.
