#   produced by "on-pr" build pipelines, i.e. pre-merge CI builds,

# METADATA
# title: Expires label
# description: >-
#   Check the image metadata for the presence of a "quay.expires-after"
#   label. If it's present then produce a violation. This check is enforced
#   only for a "release" pipeline, as determined by the value of the
#   `pipeline_intention` rule data.
# custom:
#   short_name: expires_label
#   failure_msg: The image has a 'quay.expires-after' label set to '%s'
#   solution: >-
#     Make sure the image is built without setting the "quay.expires-after" label. This
#     label is usually set if the container image was built by an "on-pr" pipeline
#     during pre-merge CI.
