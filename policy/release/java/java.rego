# METADATA
# title: Java dependency checks
# description: >-
#   This package contains a rule to confirm that all Java dependencies
#   were rebuilt in house rather than imported directly from potentially
#   untrusted respositories.
#   If the result is missing no violation is reported.
#   The rules depend on the configuration under the key
#   'allowed_java_component_sources', the key lists all component sources that are
#   allowed by the policy. The values of the list can be 'rebuilt' for
#   dependencies that have been explicitly built from sources, or the name of the
#   Maven repository names where the dependency artifact was retrieved from. The
#   Maven repositories are configured using the 'JBSConfig' custom resources.
#   Default configuration in Konflux currently includes Maven repositories with
#   names : 'jboss', 'confluent', 'redhat', 'jitpack' and 'gradle'.

# title: Java builds have no foreign dependencies
# description: >-
#   The SBOM_JAVA_COMPONENTS_COUNT task result finds dependencies that have
#   originated from foreign repositories, i.e. ones that are not rebuilt or
#   provided by Red Hat. Verify there are no dependencies from sources not
#   listed in the `allowed_java_component_sources` rule data.

#   short_name: no_foreign_dependencies
#   failure_msg: Found Java dependencies from '%s', expecting to find only from '%s'
#   solution: >-
#     Make sure there are no build dependencies that originate from foreign repositories.
#     The allowed sources are in the rule_data under the key 'allowed_java_component_sources'.
