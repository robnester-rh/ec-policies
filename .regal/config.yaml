# Configures Regal rules, see https://docs.styra.com/regal/category/rules

# In most cases, consider addressing violations even if it requires restructuring the code. Chances
# are that this will improve the code quality. If that is not feasible, then consider using an
# inline comment to ignore the rule at a particular place. As a last resort, add an entry here. If
# so, be sure to include a comment explaining why. Avoid turning violations into warnings as these
# make it difficult to detect when a new issue is detected and they end up being ignored and
# cluttering the output.
